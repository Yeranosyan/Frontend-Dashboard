# Dashdoard
```bash
I worked as a front-end developer and built a User Dashboard, which includes Bar Chart, Recent Orders, and Customers pages. To accomplish this, I used Next.js and npm to install packages and their dependencies. Additionally, I utilized Tailwind CSS for styling. I always strive to follow modern design principles. All my data is saved as an ArrayList, which is an object capable of storing a group of other objects.
